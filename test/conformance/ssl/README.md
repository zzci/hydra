This directory contains SSL certificates required for deploying Ory Hydra, the
OpenID Connect Conformity Test Suite, and other components with SSL
certificates. These certificates are loaded into the Docker Images and are seen
as valid CAs.

To generate a new CA and new SSL certificates, run `./generate.sh` in this
directory.
