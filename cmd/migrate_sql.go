upgrading Hydra 0.7.0 to 0.8.0 requires running this command.

It is recommended to run this command close to the SQL instance (e.g. same subnet) instead of over the public internet.
This decreases risk of failure and decreases time required.

You can read in the database URL using the -e flag, for example:
	export DSN=...
	hydra migrate sql -e

Before running this command on an existing database, create a back up!`,
